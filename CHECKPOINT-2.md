### CHECKPOINT.md: Checkpoint-2

#### Progress Overview
We have made significant strides in developing a robust and modular LangChain system integrated with MinIO. The system is designed to be stateless and event-driven, leveraging MinIO Object Lambda for data transformation.

#### UPDATE.md
- Implemented modular structure separating concerns into distinct components.
- Defined `models.py` for database interaction.
- Established `dependencies.py` for shared resources like MinIO client.
- Developed router modules in `app/routers/` for handling specific functionalities.
- Utility scripts in `app/utils/` provide support functions like tokenization and event handling.

#### TODO.md
- **Refine Event Handlers**: Enhance `minio_events.py` to handle various MinIO Object Lambda events.
- **Integrate LangChain Logic**: Further integrate LangChain functionalities in `langchain.py` and `langchain_minio.py`.
- **Expand Feature Store**: Extend `feature_store.py` to support diverse data structures.
- **Implement Error Handling and Logging**: Introduce robust error handling and logging mechanisms across the system.
- **Optimize for Stateless Architecture**: Ensure all components adhere to the stateless design for scalability and maintainability.
- **Testing and Documentation**: Develop comprehensive tests and documentation for all modules.

### Technical Notes
- **Stateless Architecture**: Focus on implementing stateless services to ensure scalability and ease of maintenance.
- **MinIO Object Lambda**: Utilize MinIO's Object Lambda feature for on-the-fly data transformation, ensuring that data handling is efficient and responsive to application needs.
- **FastAPI Integration**: Leverage FastAPI's capabilities for efficient API development, focusing on asynchronous handling and route organization.
- **LangChain Interaction**: Continue to explore and integrate more LangChain functionalities, ensuring that the system can handle complex workflows and data processing tasks efficiently.
